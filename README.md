## About this Dashboard

Our dashboard aims to present the sales and profit performance of Superstore. There are five main components in our dashboard which are:

1. Sales by Category Bar Plot
This plot shows the sales and profit of the stores with respect to different sub-categories in the x-axis. This plot will have a drop-down menu which will filter the data by category (furniture, office supplies, and technology). Sales and profit figures are differentiated by different colored bars.

2. Metrics Proportion by Segment Pie Chart
This plot shows the metrics proportion by segment. There are three segments in our data (consumer, corporate, and home office), each will have a different color and three metrics (sales, profit, and items sold) that the user can choose from the radio button options.

3. Sales and Profit by Ship Mode Line Chart 
This plot shows the sales and profit figures for each shipment mode. The shipment mode will be on the x-axis, the sales and profit figures will be on the y-axis.  

4. Top Five Items Sold Bar plot
This plot shows the top five items sold in a particular state. The states data for this plot will change if the user selects a different state through the US Map or the state drop-down menu below the US Map. 

5. US Map
There are three components inside this plot. The first one is a drop-down menu that the user can select to filter the data. Changing the selection of the drop-down menu will change which state is highlighted in the US Map, the predicted sales, profit, and profit margin figures, and all the other four plots discussed above. The user can also click on the map to select which state they want to view and this will also change the rest of the dashboards.
