# Project Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role:** Data Scientists at a Superstore
**Target audience:** Store sales productivity and general managers, marketing team and the CFO.

Managing one of the biggest supermarket chain in Canada is no easy task. Tracking sales and profit figures across different states and segments can be challenging as there is a lot of data to process. Data visualization tools such as a sales dashboard can help paint a clear picture on the performance of the stores in each state and segments.  



## Section 2:   
**Description of Data**  

The dataset contains details for the orders of a Superstore in the US, sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/nazarmahadialseied/superstore-sales]. This dataset will help us to understand which attribute has affected the sales and profit for the superstore sales. The dataset consists of 13 different attributes of a sample of entries. Attributes are ordinal, categorical and quantitative. Each of the rows (9994 samples) corresponds to a combination of attributes like ship mode, segment, country, city, stat, postal code, region category, sub-category, quantity, and discount with the sales and profit associated with them. The goal of this data is to establish value insights from their sales such as average sales, profits from different regions, categories, etc. which could help the Superstores make good strategies for their business future plan in the market. These estimates could be used to identify which sector of the market is under loss and which sector is making huge profits which supports the business to make appropriate decisions.
